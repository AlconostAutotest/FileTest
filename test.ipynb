    "TensorFlow matches variables to checkpointed values by traversing a directed graph with named edges, starting from the object being loaded. Edge names typically come from attribute names in objects, for example the `\"l1\"` in `self.l1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(5)`. `tf.train.Checkpoint` uses its keyword argument names, as in the `\"step\"` in `tf.train.Checkpoint(step=...)`.\n",

    "Slot variables are part of the optimizer's state, but are created for a specific variable. For example the `'m'` edges above correspond to momentum, which the Adam optimizer tracks for each variable. Slot variables are only saved in a checkpoint if the variable and the optimizer would both be saved, thus the dashed edges."
